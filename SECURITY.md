# Security Policy

Siemens takes the security of its code seriously. If you think you have found a security vulnerability,
please read the next sections and follow the instructions to report your finding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report any potential security vulnerability via a public channel (mailing list, GitHub issue etc.).
Instead, [report the vulnerability privately via GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
(if enabled for the repository) or [contact us via email](mailto:opensource@siemens.com).

Please provide a detailed description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, the affected versions and, if already available,
a proposal for a fix. You should receive a response within 5 working days.
